# Exploring_Profit_Data_NationWide
In this project, I explored the data for earnings of branches nation wide over 4 years, 2014-2017. Looking at the net profits, gross profits, and losses over the years. Also, breaking the profits and losses down by market segment, product category, and state to see which contributes how much  to the profits and losses.
